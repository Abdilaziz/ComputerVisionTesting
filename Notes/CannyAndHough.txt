Canny is used to detect edges.

Edges in images are detected through the use of the gradient to calculate the changes from one pixel to the next.
Gradient gives rate of change in x and y direction.

The gradient of an image can be taken through the use of convolution/correlation with a special matrix (operator).
The most common one is the sobel operator. Taking the deriviative of a function is an operation that is sensitive to noise, so differentiate
your image only after you filter out noise (blur your image). 

Due to the linearity of convultion, you can differentiate the filter matrix to get a single matrix to multply your image by.



Hough Transform.

Hough transform allows you to get information of something that appears in an image.
It uses the edges (points) produced in by the canny algorithm.

It uses the process of voting, which means that the points obtained for the edge locations are used to determine the models of the objects
to be found in the image. 
Ex. If you are looking for a line in the image. y=mx+b. the points (x0,y0) are used to determine m and b (b= -mx+y). Model lines with 
	speherical coordinates.
	d = xcos(theta) - ysin(theta). where theta is 0-180 and d can be a negative value.
	Each point corresponds to a line in the hough space.

Voting: each point corresponds to a sine wave in the hough space, with the point with the most intersections is the correct value for d and theta

The hough transform algorithm is cubic with the number of parameters required for the model
Ex. for a circle, (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2
	center of the circle (a,b) and the radius r are unkown.
	(x,y points are edge points on a circle)
