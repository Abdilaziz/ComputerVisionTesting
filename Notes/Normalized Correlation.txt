Normalized Correlation

If we correlated an image with a filter where we want the standard deviation of the filter to be 1.

When comparing 2 filters output when correlated to an image, the scales of those filters should be the same

Therefore make the standard deviation of the filter needs to be 1. That is a way of normalizing the filter.

When the window is over the image and filtering, we should also normalize that patch of the image so that its standard deviation is also 1. Then compute the correlation.


When correlating an image with a chunk of that same image (Normalized correlation), the maximum values of the result is when that filtering window was correlating over the same chunk in the full image.



Therefore you can use normal correlation to find where a part of an image occurs in a larger image. (The brightest part of the output (Max value))
