Images are functions of their position. I(x,y) =Z, where z is the pixel value.


Image processing just does things to the function.

If you were to graph that xy position of the image, you can for example smooth it and the image output is more blurry


function from R2 (x and y values) to R(an intensity value).

values of intensity for black and white images is 8 bits (0-255 value)

for color images, it is a combo of 3 functions(channels): [r(x,y), g(x,y), b(x,y)} red, green, blue
It is a vector value function, so each pixel has 3 values

X i horizontal, and Y is vertical
